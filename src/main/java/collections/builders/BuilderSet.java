/**
 * This {@code BuilderSet} can be used to quickly construct a set from another collection or as a base
 * class to simplify building a set that self populates from a custom type.
 * <p/>
 * It is constructed with a {@link Builder} and a backing {@link Set}.
 * <p/>
 * The {@link Builder#build()} method must be implemented to provide the logic that will be used to build each element
 * to be contain within the set. The {@link Builder#build()} method will be repeatedly called until it returns
 * {@code null}.
 * <p/>
 * The backing set is the actual set that will hold the built elements. If no backing set is supplied then a
 * {@link HashSet} will be used.
 * <p/>
 * Example:
 * <code>
 *      Set<String> set = new TreeSet<>();
 *      set.add("one");
 *      set.add("two");
 *      set.add("three");
 * <p/>
 *      final Iterator<String> numbers = Arrays.asList("four", "five", "six").iterator();
 * <p/>
 *      Set<String> builderSet = new BuilderSet<>(new Builder<String>() {
 * <p/>
 *          private int i = 0;
 * <p/>
 *          public String build() {
 * <p/>
 *              if (numbers.hasNext()) return numbers.next();
 * <p/>
 *              return null;
 *          }
 *      }, set); // [five, four, one, six, three, two]
 * </code>
